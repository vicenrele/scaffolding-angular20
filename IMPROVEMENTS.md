# Recommended Libraries for Improving

Below is a list of useful libraries that can be added to project's `package.json`, categorized by their purpose, along with a brief explanation of what each is used for:

---

- **husky**  
  Lets you run scripts on Git hooks (e.g., to launch linting or tests before commits or pushes).
- **lint-staged**  
  Runs linters (like eslint or prettier) only on the staged files, speeding up the validation process.

  A static documentation generator for Angular projects. Provides visual, navigable documentation for components, services, routes, etc.

### 3. **Performance**
- **ngx-quicklink**

### 4. **Testing and Coverage**
- **jest**  
  Alternative to Karma/Jasmine for unit testing, very fast and well-integrated with CI.
- **cypress**
